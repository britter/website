      In today’s world, every business is essentially a software business.
      Whether you’re developing products, services, or solutions, software is at
      the heart of it all. To remain competitive and successful, companies need
      to scale up their engineering efforts in tandem with their growth. This
      means building strong, efficient, and highly productive engineering teams
      that can deliver on the ever-increasing demands of the business.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8">
      I’ve had the privilege of witnessing firsthand how an engineering team can
      scale and evolve. At Gradle Inc., I played a key role in scaling the
      engineering team from 30 to over 100 engineers. The team is fully remote
      while maintaining exceptional efficiency and impact. By focusing on
      effective processes, strong communication, and team alignment, we were
      able to consistently deliver high-impact features on time, while keeping
      productivity high and burnout low.

    <p class="mb-8">
      With my experience building and scaling high-performing engineering teams,
      I understand the processes and structures that need to be put in place as
      teams grow. I can help you develop scalable engineering practices, foster
      a collaborative culture, and implement the right tools to support your
      team’s success as your business evolves.
