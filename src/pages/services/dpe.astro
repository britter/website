      Developer Productivity Engineering (DPE) is rapidly emerging as the next
      big thing in software development, following in the footsteps of DevOps.
      As organizations strive to scale and innovate faster, optimizing the
      developer experience has become a key competitive advantage.
      High-performing teams around the globe are adopting DPE practices to
      enhance efficiency, streamline workflows, and minimize bottlenecks,
      ultimately allowing developers to focus more on writing high-quality code
      and less on dealing with friction in their toolchains.
