# Terms and Conditions (Public Version)

## 1. Introduction

These terms outline the general conditions under which I operate as a freelancer. They provide transparency regarding my working methods, availability, and intellectual property considerations. **Full terms and conditions, including detailed payment terms, confidentiality agreements, and liability clauses, will be shared with clients upon engagement.**

## 2. Contract Structure

I charge by the hour to provide flexibility and accommodate the dynamic nature of freelance work. The hourly rate is subject to negotiation and depends on the scope of work.

## 3. Availability

- I typically work four days per week, reserving one day per week for business development activities.
- I work during CET (UTC+1) business hours.
- Meetings outside of standard business hours should be the exception and require prior notice.

## 4. Quotations

- Any quotations provided are valid for a period of **14 days** from the date of issuance, unless otherwise specified in writing.
- Quotations are estimates based on the provided project scope and may be subject to adjustments if the requirements change.
- A quotation does not constitute a binding contract until formally agreed upon by both parties.
- Work is scheduled based on availability at the time of contract signing. A valid quotation does not guarantee availability, and I reserve the right to prioritize engagements on a first-come, first-served basis.

## 5. Work Environment, Location, and Tooling

### Work Location

- I work exclusively remotely, primarily from my home office.
- Occasionally, I may work from public places such as libraries or cafes.
- On-site work is only available in exceptional cases, such as kick-off meetings or conducting training sessions.
- I only travel to destinations that are reachable via the German public train system.
- If the round-trip travel time exceeds **four hours**, I will arrange for an overnight stay at the clientâ€™s expense.

### Travel Expenses

- If on-site work is required, the client agrees to cover all travel-related expenses, including transportation, accommodation, and reasonable meal costs.
- Travel time will be billed at the agreed-upon hourly rate.
- All travel arrangements will be made in coordination with the client to ensure cost efficiency.

### Tooling

- I work on my own hardware running the Linux operating system (specifically the NixOS distribution).
- I independently select and configure my development environment using open-source tools, including but not limited to fish shell, tmux, NeoVim, and IntelliJ.
- While I am open to using specific client-requested tools when necessary for collaboration (e.g., access to a private repository or CI/CD pipeline), I reserve the right to refuse the use of inefficient, proprietary, or restrictive tooling that negatively impacts productivity or security.

## 6. Intellectual Property Rights

- I believe in the value of open-source software and, as part of my work, I may report issues to open-source projects without sharing client details.
- If beneficial to the client project, I may also contribute trivial fixes and improvements to open-source projects. These contributions are not considered part of the deliverables transferred to the client.
- If a non-trivial fix to an open-source component is required to ensure the success of the client project, I will first seek written approval from the client to allocate paid time for such contributions.
- Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all intellectual property rights to work created during the engagement remain with me until full payment has been received.
- Upon full payment, the client is granted full ownership of the specific deliverables created for their project. However, I retain the right to extract and reuse generic, non-client-specific components as part of free and open-source libraries, provided that no confidential or proprietary information is disclosed.

- I reserve the right to showcase the work in my portfolio, unless the client requests confidentiality in writing.

## 7. Confidentiality & Non-Disclosure

- Confidentiality agreements are included in my full terms and conditions and will be shared with clients upon engagement.
- I use Proton Mail ([https://proton.me](https://proton.me)), a privacy-respecting email service hosted in Switzerland, for email communication.
- I only use other communication channels if they are accepted by the client. Sending me a direct message on any communication platform, such as the Gradle Community Slack workspace, is considered an acceptance of that channel by the client.

## 8. Termination & Cancellation

- Either party may terminate the agreement with a written notice period.
- The client is responsible for payment of all hours worked up to the termination date.
- Any outstanding invoices must be settled before termination is finalized.

## 9. Dispute Resolution & Governing Law

- In the event of a dispute, both parties agree to first attempt to resolve the issue through good-faith negotiations.
- If negotiations fail, both parties agree to seek mediation before pursuing legal action.
- This agreement shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Germany.
- Any disputes arising from or related to this agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Germany.

## 10. Final Note

These public terms serve as a general guideline. Full terms and conditions, including detailed confidentiality, liability, and payment clauses, will be provided upon request or upon engagement. Specific agreements may be negotiated on a case-by-case basis to suit the needs of both parties.
