      These are the Developer Productivity services I offer to help teams work
      more efficiently and effectively. If none of these services align with
      your needs, I am also available for software development projects, where I
      excel as a strong individual contributor. I can deliver features
      end-to-end, from gathering requirements and designing solutions to
      building architectures, implementing code, testing, and ensuring smooth
      delivery.
